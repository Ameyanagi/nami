# Design

## Principles

- Mojo is the runtime implementation language.
- Prefer pure Mojo and safe standard-library APIs.
- Keep the root API small, typed, documented, and testable.
- Separate semantic contracts from optimized CPU, SIMD, GPU, terminal, or
  rendering backends.
- Establish correctness and reference fixtures before optimization.
- Make invalid public configuration unrepresentable when practical; otherwise
  reject it explicitly.
- Preserve source mappings, numerical tolerances, ownership, and provenance as
  first-class data when the domain requires them.
- Do not add a framework-wide array, executor, renderer, or application model.

## Tradeoffs

The project accepts a narrower initial feature set in exchange for reviewable
contracts and sparse dependencies. Generated tables are acceptable when their
sources, Unicode or data version, licenses, checksums, and deterministic update
procedure are committed. Consumers must not need the generator toolchain.

Window sampling and normalization are nominal values rather than booleans so a
call site states its mathematical intent. The default window values are direct
evaluations of their conventional cosine formulas. In particular, an even
symmetric window need not contain a sample equal to one. Peak normalization is
an explicit second operation, never an implicit correction. It rejects a
sampled peak at or below `1e-15`, avoiding unstable amplification of a
mathematically zero window's floating-point residue.

## Out of scope

Audio devices, codecs, media pipelines, plotting, interpolation, optimization, and a second FFT implementation are outside this package.
